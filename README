Vinace - VINtage Apple Computer Emulator
========================================

Requirements
------------

Vinace needs gtkmm-2.4 and libpulse0 packages to be installed.

Vinace needs ROM image which are copyrighted and which can not be distributed with Vinace.

Current version uses file named APPLE2E.ROM contained in zip file located at :
ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/emulators/rom_images/apple_iie_rom.zip

How to test Vinace ?
--------------------

If you want to build it from source :

1 - Download the source
2 - Enter trunk directory
3 - ./configure
4 - make
5 - Enter src/gui directory
6 - Copy ROM file APPLE2E.ROM into this directory
7 - ./vinace

If you don't want to build it from source but still want to try it :

1 - Download the binary
2 - tar xvf vinace.gz
3 - Enter the vinace directory
4 - Copy ROM file APPLE2E.ROM into this directory
5 - ./vinace

If you don't want to try it, get back to the dull 64 bits world.

Inside Vinace
-------------

Now you should see a color screen and two disk drives.

Use the keyboard to type text in. The special keys are :

On your machine             On the emulated Apple
-------------------------------------------------------------
Ctrl-Break or Ctrl-Pause    Ctrl-Reset
Left Alt                    Open Apple (joystick button 0)
Right Alt                   Closed Apple (joystick button 1)

You can issue a first Ctrl-Break to try Applesoft basic. And of course, a 
Alt-Ctrl-Break will restart the computer (the Apple, not your actual computer).

If you want to use floppy disks, you can go to 
ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/images

Vinace accept any file but works only with .dsk and .do files (DOS ordered disk
images). To insert a disk, just drag the file onto the disk drive 1. The lid 
should automatically close. Then restart with a Alt-Ctrl-Break.

Disk drives are emulated with the same original speed which is quite... slow.

You can look if something is happening on the terminal output (look after 
drive's head position changing, which means that the program is still alive).
